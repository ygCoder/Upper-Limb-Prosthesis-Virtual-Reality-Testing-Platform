# Upper-Limb-Prosthesis-Virtual-Reality-Testing-Platform
Feel free to use and modify this platform for evaluating the control of upper-limb prosthesis or rehabilitation outcomes.

The following category of models have been included in the virtual reality environment (VRE): prosthetic body and arm, objects that the prosthesis will interact with, scenic objects (such as table and chair), and visual cue objects (such as the cone depicting whether the prosthetic hand is within the grasp threshold)

As part of the the virtual reality platform repository, we're including the trajectory data used for the Trajectory Control. This includes 5 wrist trajectories (see image below), 11 elbow-wrist trajectories, and 11 elbow-wrist-shoulder trajectories
