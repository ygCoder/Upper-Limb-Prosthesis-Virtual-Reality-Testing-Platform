# Upper-Limb-Prosthesis-Virtual-Reality-Testing-Platform
#### Feel free to use and modify this platform for evaluating the control of upper-limb prosthesis or rehabilitation outcomes.

This virtual reality platform was developed for research purposes only. Please refer to the following publication to view further detail as well as an example of its use:

###### Yuri Gloumakov, Joao Bimbo, and Aaron M. Dollar, "[Trajectory Control for 3 Degree of Freedom Wrist Prosthesis in Virtual Reality: A Pilot Study](https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/pubs/Gloumakov_BIOROB2020.pdf)", *IEEE proceedings of the International Conference for Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob)*, 2020.

The following category of models have been included in the virtual reality environment (VRE): prosthetic body and arm, objects that the prosthesis will interact with, scenic objects (such as table and chair), and visual cue objects (such as the cone depicting whether the prosthetic hand is within the grasp threshold)

Below you can see an example of a drinking task. Note the the change in the visual cue as the virtual prosthetic hand approached the object.

The following image depicts a participant wearing the head mounted display (HMD) and operating a prosthetic device using the HTC Vive Controller. Although not necessary, Vicon markers are tracked and displayed in the image as part of a separate analysis.

As part of the the virtual reality platform repository, we're including the trajectory data used for the Trajectory Control. This includes the 5 wrist trajectories (see image below). Pairs of virtual hands demonstrate the two ends of each motion trajectory.
